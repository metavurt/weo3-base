    <p>I’m Billy and I enjoy building things for the web. Although I have a penchant for wanting things to be well-designed and pretty, my core desire is that things work as they should, for as long as they possibly can, with headache-free maintanence.</p>

    <!-- <p>Belief/philosophy</p> -->
    <p>My daily inspiration comes from nature, music, and various online communities of developers, artists, and musicians.</p>

    <p>Technology never ceases to evolve, and my curiosity is, fortunately, never-ending. I am constantly keeping abreast of what new version or next iteration of current technology has been released, and applying what I can to current codebases.</p>
